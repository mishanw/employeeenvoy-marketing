## Company Description

**For LinkedIn About Section (1,847 characters)**

Employee Envoy is the employee lifecycle management platform that transforms how IT teams handle onboarding, offboarding, and status changes.

Every day, IT teams waste hours on repetitive provisioning tasks: creating accounts across dozens of systems, assigning licenses, configuring access permissions, and then reversing it all when someone leaves. It's tedious, error-prone, and creates real security risks when steps get missed.

We built Employee Envoy to eliminate this burden entirely.

**What We Do:**
Our platform automates the complete employee lifecycle across 120+ integrations including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Okta, Slack, Salesforce, GitHub, and many more. When someone joins, moves teams, or leaves your organization, Employee Envoy executes every provisioning and deprovisioning action automatically, based on your customized workflows.

**Why Teams Choose Us:**

- Reduce IT provisioning time by up to 90%
- Eliminate orphaned accounts and security gaps from incomplete offboarding
- Full audit logging for compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- SCIM and SSO support for enterprise-grade identity management
- Purpose-built for MSPs managing multiple client environments

**Who We Serve:**
MSPs (Managed Service Providers), IT teams at growing companies, and organizations serious about security and operational efficiency.

**Our Mission:**
To give IT teams their time back while ensuring every employee has exactly the right access, at the right time, with zero manual effort.

Whether you're onboarding 5 employees or 500, Employee Envoy scales with you. No more spreadsheets. No more tickets. No more security gaps.

### POST 1: Thought Leadership - The Hidden Cost of Manual Provisioning

**Type:** Thought Leadership
**Best Posting Time:** Tuesday, 8:00 AM (local timezone)

---

**Post Text:**

The average IT team spends 45 minutes provisioning a single new hire.

Multiply that by every employee, contractor, and role change in your organization.

Now multiply it again by every system they need access to:
- Email and calendar
- File storage
- Chat and collaboration tools
- CRM and sales tools
- Development environments
- Security and compliance tools

That's not IT work. That's data entry.

And here's what keeps me up at night: the offboarding side is even worse.

When someone leaves, incomplete deprovisioning creates security gaps. Orphaned accounts. Licenses you're still paying for. Access that should have been revoked weeks ago.

The companies getting this right aren't doing it manually. They're automating the entire employee lifecycle, so their IT teams can focus on work that actually moves the needle.

The question isn't whether to automate. It's how long you can afford not to.

What's your biggest pain point with employee provisioning?

### POST 2: Thought Leadership - Security Starts at Offboarding

**Type:** Thought Leadership
**Best Posting Time:** Wednesday, 9:00 AM

---

**Post Text:**

Your biggest security vulnerability might be sitting in your deprovisioning process.

I've talked to hundreds of IT leaders this year. Here's what I keep hearing:

"We have a checklist for offboarding."
"It's mostly followed."
"Usually."

That "usually" is where breaches happen.

Consider this:

A former employee still has access to:
- Customer data in your CRM
- Proprietary code in your repositories
- Financial records in your ERP
- Client communications in shared drives

Not because anyone wanted them to. Because someone missed a step on a Friday afternoon when three people were leaving and a critical project was on fire.

Manual processes fail when humans are busy, stressed, or simply have too many systems to remember.

The solution isn't longer checklists or more reminders.

The solution is removing humans from the equation entirely for routine deprovisioning tasks.

Automated offboarding. Every account. Every system. Every time.

When was the last time you audited your offboarding completeness?

### POST 3: Product Feature Highlight - 120+ Integrations

**Type:** Product Feature
**Best Posting Time:** Thursday, 10:00 AM

---

**Post Text:**

"Does it work with [insert tool]?"

We get this question a lot. So here's the answer:

Employee Envoy integrates with 120+ business applications out of the box.

**Identity & Access:**
Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Active Directory, JumpCloud, OneLogin

**Productivity:**
Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Zoom, Notion

**Development:**
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence, AWS, Azure

**Business Systems:**
Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, QuickBooks, NetSuite

**Security:**
CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, 1Password, Keeper, Duo

And that's just the start.

Why does this matter?

Because your employee lifecycle doesn't happen in one system. It happens across every tool your team uses.

When Sarah from Marketing gets promoted to Director, her access needs change in 15+ systems. When James from Engineering leaves, his credentials need to be revoked everywhere. Immediately.

One platform. 120+ integrations. Zero manual provisioning.

### POST 4: Product Feature Highlight - Audit Logging & Compliance

**Type:** Product Feature
**Best Posting Time:** Tuesday, 11:00 AM

---

**Post Text:**

"When was John's access revoked?"

"Who approved Sarah's admin privileges?"

"Can you prove our offboarding was compliant?"

If these questions make you nervous, we should talk.

Employee Envoy maintains a complete audit trail of every action, every change, and every approval in your employee lifecycle.

**What gets logged:**

Every user account created, modified, or disabled
Every group membership change
Every license assignment or removal
Every approval workflow and who approved it
Every integration action with timestamps
Every failed action and retry attempt

**Why it matters:**

SOC 2 auditors want proof your access controls work
HIPAA requires documentation of who had access to what
GDPR demands you can demonstrate data access governance
Your security team needs to investigate incidents quickly

**What you get:**

Exportable reports for any time period
Real-time activity feeds
Searchable logs across all integrations
Retention policies that match your compliance requirements

Compliance isn't about checking boxes. It's about having confidence that you can answer any question about who had access to what, and when.

What compliance framework are you working toward?

### POST 5: Customer Pain Point - The Onboarding Monday Chaos

**Type:** Pain Point / Relatable Scenario
**Best Posting Time:** Monday, 8:30 AM

---

**Post Text:**

It's 8:47 AM on Monday.

You've got 6 new hires starting today.

Your inbox already has 23 "I can't log in" messages.

HR sent the new hire list on Friday at 5:45 PM.

Two of them need admin access "urgently."

One was supposed to start last week but nobody told IT.

The hiring manager is asking why their new senior engineer can't access GitHub yet.

Your coffee is getting cold.

Sound familiar?

This is the reality for IT teams at growing companies. Every. Single. Monday.

Here's the thing: it doesn't have to be this way.

Imagine this instead:

- New hire data syncs from your HRIS automatically
- Provisioning workflows trigger based on department and role
- Every account, every system, every permission, configured before day one
- New employees log in on Monday morning and everything just works

No emergency tickets. No "urgent" access requests. No cold coffee.

That's what automated employee lifecycle management looks like.

What's your Monday morning IT horror story?

### POST 6: Customer Pain Point - The Offboarding Security Gap

**Type:** Pain Point / Relatable Scenario
**Best Posting Time:** Thursday, 2:00 PM

---

**Post Text:**

A true story from an IT leader I spoke with last month:

"We had an employee leave in March. Routine departure. Exit interview done. Laptop returned. Badge deactivated.

Six months later, our security team found they were still logging into our Salesforce. Weekly. For six months.

We had 'completed' their offboarding checklist."

This isn't rare. It's terrifyingly common.

The average organization uses 110+ SaaS applications. Your offboarding checklist might have 15 items on it.

Where are the other 95?

Here's what typically gets missed:

- That project management tool only one team uses
- The analytics platform they signed up for themselves
- Shared service accounts they had access to
- Third-party vendor portals
- Shadow IT applications nobody knew about

Every missed deprovisioning step is:
- A potential security breach
- A compliance violation
- A license you're still paying for

Automated offboarding doesn't miss steps. It doesn't forget systems. It doesn't have busy Fridays.

How confident are you that your last 10 offboardings were 100% complete?

### POST 7: Industry Insight - The State of IT Provisioning

**Type:** Industry Insight / Statistics
**Best Posting Time:** Wednesday, 10:00 AM

---

**Post Text:**

The numbers behind employee provisioning tell a story:

**45 minutes** - Average time to manually provision a new employee across core systems

**$5,000** - Estimated cost of a delayed start due to access issues (productivity + IT time + manager time)

**30%** - Percentage of organizations that have experienced a security incident due to incomplete offboarding

**110+** - Average number of SaaS applications used by mid-size companies

**4.5 hours** - Average IT time spent weekly on routine user provisioning and deprovisioning

**68%** - Percentage of IT teams still using manual processes or spreadsheets for employee lifecycle management

**90%** - Reduction in provisioning time achieved through automation

Here's what these numbers really mean:

IT teams are spending significant portions of their week on work that could be fully automated.

Meanwhile, the security gaps from manual processes are creating real risk.

The companies pulling ahead aren't hiring more IT staff. They're automating the routine work so their existing teams can focus on strategic initiatives.

Which number resonates most with your experience?

### POST 8: Industry Insight - MSP Market Trends

**Type:** Industry Insight
**Best Posting Time:** Tuesday, 3:00 PM

---

**Post Text:**

MSPs are facing a fundamental shift in how they deliver IT services.

The old model: Reactive support. Break-fix. Hourly billing.

The new reality: Proactive management. Automation. Predictable value.

Here's what we're seeing in the MSP market:

**The efficiency mandate is real**

With talent costs rising and client expectations increasing, MSPs can't afford to do things the old way. Manual user provisioning across multiple client environments doesn't scale.

**Security is a differentiator**

Clients are asking harder questions about offboarding processes, access controls, and audit trails. MSPs who can demonstrate automated, consistent processes win more business.

**Multi-tenant tooling is essential**

Managing employee lifecycles across 10, 50, or 100 client environments requires purpose-built solutions. Consumer-grade tools don't cut it.

**Standardization drives profitability**

The most successful MSPs we work with have standardized their provisioning workflows. Same process, every client, every time. Automation makes this possible.

The MSPs winning right now aren't the biggest. They're the most efficient.

What's the biggest challenge in your MSP operations today?

### POST 9: Company Culture - Why We Built Employee Envoy

**Type:** Company Culture / Team
**Best Posting Time:** Friday, 9:00 AM

---

**Post Text:**

We didn't start Employee Envoy because we wanted to build another SaaS product.

We started it because we lived the problem.

Our founding team spent years in IT operations and MSP environments. We experienced firsthand:

- The Monday morning chaos when new hires couldn't access their tools
- The Friday afternoon scramble to offboard departing employees
- The audit prep panic when compliance requirements changed
- The security incidents that happened despite "following the process"

We knew there had to be a better way.

So we built it.

**Our principles:**

**Automation first.** If it can be automated, it should be. Humans should focus on decisions, not data entry.

**Security by design.** Every feature we build considers the security implications. Audit logging isn't an afterthought.

**Integration depth.** Connecting to an API isn't enough. We build deep integrations that handle real-world complexity.

**MSP-native thinking.** Multi-tenant, multi-client, multi-environment. Because that's how our customers operate.

We're still a small team, but we're growing. And we're building something that we would have wanted when we were on the other side.

If you're passionate about solving real IT problems, we'd love to hear from you.
