4.5 hours.

That's how long the average IT team spends onboarding a single employee.

Multiply that by 50 new hires a year and you're looking at 225 hours of manual work.

That's almost 6 full work weeks.

What could your team accomplish with 6 extra weeks?

Employee Envoy customers cut that time by 73%.

The math is simple. The ROI is massive.
